This script allows you to complete Fortran 90 structures by pressing <F7>.

The plugin in written in python, so you need to have your vim compiled with python support in order to use it.

The intention is to complete program, type, interface, module, subroutine, function, do, and select constructs. You write the first line of such a construct (e.g. subroutine foo(a, b), then press <F7>, and the script will add the closing line end subroutine foo and put the cursor between the two lines, indented by one level.
